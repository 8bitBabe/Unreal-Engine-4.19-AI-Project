# Unreal-Engine-4.19-AI-Project
Project for simple NPC's class using blueprints and behavior trees. 
The point of the game is to find your hat as based on the story book "I Want My Hat Back" by John Klassen.

Made as a final project for a basic AI class for Unreal Engine.
The goal was to implement basic NPC's using blueprints and/or behavior trees that reacted to stimuli that 
depended on how far along you were in the "story".
Character designs taken from and animated in the Adobe Mixamo program.
Mechanics made by myself.
Runs on Unreal Engine 4.19 and above.
